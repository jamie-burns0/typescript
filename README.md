# new-era
This is kind of a workspace area for small coding projects in various languages - Java, Python, Typescript and Rust.

I've organised each language onto it's own branch. 

Rational is, I'm trying this approach over having a repository per language or a folder in the root per language. Using this approach, I only need one repository, and switching to a language is just checkout the language branch. I also have a Kali Linux WSL distro configured for each language. At this stage I only have to clone one repository and checkout the language branch on each distro.
